# 🤖 AI Learning Journey

Welcome to your **AI Learning Journey** 🚀\
This repository is a **living roadmap** designed to guide you from
beginner to AI practitioner. Your progress in this journey depends largely on you: on the time, effort, and **consistency** you are willing to invest. Learning AI just like learning anything else; it requires curiosity, patience and a lot of it, and the courage to experiment and fail.

This repository serves as a roadmap, not a shortcut. It shows you where to go and what to learn, but you must take the steps yourself. There will be moments of confusion and frustration,  this is normal and expected. What matters is showing up consistently, writing code, breaking things, fixing them, and pushing your work to GitHub.

> 🎯 Goal: Build strong fundamentals, real projects, and a public AI
> portfolio.
