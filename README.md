# 🤖 AI Learning Journey

Welcome to your **AI Learning Journey** 🚀\
This repository is a living roadmap designed to guide you from beginner to AI practitioner. Your progress along this journey depends largely on:

-   the time you invest,

-   the effort you put in, and

-   the consistency you maintain over time.

Stay patient, stay curious, and **remember** small, regular steps lead to meaningful progress and significant change.

Learning AI just like learning anything else; it requires curiosity, patience and a lot of it, and the courage to experiment and fail.

This repository serves as a roadmap, not a shortcut. It shows you where to go and what to learn, but you must take the steps yourself, and you can also explore other resources and directions as you progress. 

There will be moments of confusion and frustration,  this is normal and expected. What matters is showing up consistently, writing code, breaking things, fixing them, and pushing your work to GitHub.

> 🎯 Goal: Build strong fundamentals, real projects, and a public AI
> portfolio.

> 📌 **Note**
>  
> This repository is a work in progress and will be **continuously updated** with improvements, new content, and refinements over time.  
> Please check back regularly for the latest updates.
