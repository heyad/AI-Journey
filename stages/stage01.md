## 🛠 Tools & Skills 


Getting started with AI might seem challenging, but our path here begins with two foundational skills: Python and GitHub. Python is the most common programming language in AI world: simple syntax and powerful libraries (like TensorFlow and PyTorch) necessary to build intelligent systems.  

GitHub is your collaborative workspace and professional portfolio. It allows you to save, version-control, and share your code, enabling you to work on complex projects, and showcase your machine learning models to potential employers. 

### IDE Tools 

The first thing you need when starting to code in Python is an IDE (Integrated Development Environment). An IDE is a tool that helps you write, run, debug, and organize your code more efficiently than a simple text editor. There are many IDEs available for Python development. Below are three of the most common and beginner-friendly options, along with why you might choose each one and how to get started.

1. Visual Studio Code (VS Code): Visual Studio Code is a lightweight, free, and extremely popular code editor that becomes a powerful Python IDE through extensions. Download from the official website: https://code.visualstudio.com


2. Jupyter Notebook: Best for Learning & Experimentation. Jupyter Notebook is an interactive environment where you write and run Python code in small blocks (cells), alongside explanations, equations, and visualizations. Install via Anaconda, which includes Python, Jupyter, and many useful libraries https://www.anaconda.com  Or install directly using pip:

`pip install notebook`
