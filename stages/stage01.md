Getting started with AI might seem challenging, but our path here begins with two foundational skills: Python and GitHub. Python is the most common programming language in AI world: simple syntax and powerful libraries (like TensorFlow and PyTorch) necessary to build intelligent systems.  

GitHub is your collaborative workspace and professional portfolio. It allows you to save, version-control, and share your code, enabling you to work on complex projects, and showcase your machine learning models to potential employers.
