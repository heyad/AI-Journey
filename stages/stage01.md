Getting started with AI might seem challenging, but our path here begins with two foundational skills: Python and GitHub. Python is the undisputed champion of the AI world, providing the simple syntax and powerful libraries (like TensorFlow and PyTorch) necessary to build intelligent systems. Learning Python is like mastering the basic language of computing. Once you have this language, GitHub becomes your collaborative workspace and professional portfolio. It allows you to save, version-control, and share your code, enabling you to work on complex projects, and showcase your machine learning models to potential employers.
