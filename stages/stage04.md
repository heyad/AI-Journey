## Deep Learning 

Neural Networks are the key building blocks of deep learnign-based methods. 

### Learning Outcomes 

1. Neural networks
2. Backpropagation
3. CNNs & RNNs (conceptual + light implementation)
4. Transfer Learning and Common Architectures (VGG16, ResNet, etc...)
4. Frameworks: PyTorch or TensorFlow
5. Why deep learning changed everything
